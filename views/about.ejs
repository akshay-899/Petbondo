      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>We are passionate about connecting loving homes with wonderful animals in need. We believe every pet deserves a safe and happy place to call home, and we strive to make that dream a reality.</p>

      <p>Here at Petbondo, we are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dedicated to animal welfare: We work closely with shelters and rescues to find loving homes for cats, dogs, and other animals who have been abandoned, surrendered, or neglected.</li>
        <li>Committed to responsible pet ownership: We believe in educating potential adopters about the lifelong commitment of caring for a pet. We provide resources and support to help ensure successful adoptions and happy lives for both pets and their families.</li>
        <li>Driven by compassion: We understand the bond between humans and animals and the positive impact pets can have on our lives. We are dedicated to finding the perfect match for both the pet and the adopter.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to facilitate the adoption of homeless animals by:</p>

        <li>Offering detailed profiles of each animal, including their personality, needs, and history.</li>
